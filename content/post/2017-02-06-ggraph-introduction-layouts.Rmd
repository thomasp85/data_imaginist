I will soon submit `ggraph` to CRAN - I swear! But in the meantime I've decided 
to build up anticipation for the great event by publishing a range of blog posts
describing the central parts of `ggraph`: *Layouts*, *Nodes*, *Edges*, and 
*Connections*. All of these posts will be included with ggraph as vignettes --- 
potentially in slightly modified form. To kick off everything we'll start with
the first thing you'll have to think about when plotting a graph structure...

## Layouts
In very short terms, a layout is the vertical and horizontal placement of nodes
when plotting a particular graph structure. Conversely, a layout algorithm is an
algorithm that takes in a graph structure (and potentially some additional 
parameters) and return the vertical and horizontal position of the nodes. Often,
when people think of network visualizations, they think of node-edge diagrams
where strongly connected nodes are attempted to be plotted in close proximity.
Layouts can be a lot of other things too though --- e.g. hive plots and 
treemaps. One of the driving factors behind `ggraph` has been to develop an API
where any type of visual representation of graph structures is supported. In 
order to achieve this we first need a flexible way of defining the layout...

### `ggraph()` and `create_layout()`
As the layout is a global specification of the spatial position of the nodes it
spans all layers in the plot and should thus be defined outside of calls to 
geoms or stats. In `ggraph` it is often done as part of the plot initialization
using `ggraph()` --- a function equivalent in intent to `ggplot()`. As a minimum
`ggraph()` must be passed a graph object supported by `ggraph`:

```{r}
library(ggraph)
library(igraph)
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(highschool)

# Not specifying the layout - defaults to "auto"
ggraph(graph) + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(colour = factor(year))) + 
    geom_node_point()
```

Not specifying a layout will make `ggraph` pick one for you. This is only 
intended to get quickly up and running. The choice of layout should be 
deliberate on the part of the user as it will have a great effect on what the 
end result will communicate. From now on all calls to `ggraph()` will contain a
specification of the layout:

```{r}
ggraph(graph, layout = 'kk') + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(colour = factor(year))) + 
    geom_node_point()
```

If the layout algorithm accepts additional parameters (most do), they can be
supplied in the call to `ggraph()` as well:

```{r}
ggraph(graph, layout = 'kk', maxiter = 100) + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(colour = factor(year))) + 
    geom_node_point()
```

In addition to specifying the layout during plot creation it can also happen 
separately using `create_layout()`. This function takes the same arguments as 
`ggraph()` but returns a `layout_ggraph` object that can later be used in place
of a graph structure in ggraph call:

```{r}
layout <- create_layout(graph, layout = 'drl')
ggraph(layout) + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(colour = factor(year))) + 
    geom_node_point()
```

Examining the return of `create_layout()` we see that it is really just a 
`data.frame` of node positions and (possible) attributes. Furthermore the 
original graph object along with other relevant information is passed along as
attributes:

```{r}
head(layout)
```

```{r}
attributes(layout)
```

As it is just a `data.frame` it means that any standard `ggplot2` call will work
by addressing the nodes. Still, use of the `geom_node_*()` family provided by 
`ggraph` is encouraged as it makes it explicit which part of the data structure
is being worked with.

### Adding support for new data sources
Out of the box `ggraph` supports `dendrogram` and `igraph` objects natively as
well as `hclust` and `network` through conversion to one of the above. If there
is wish for support for additional classes this can be achieved by adding a set
of specific methods to the class. The `ggraph` source code should be your guide
in this but I will briefly describe the methods below:

#### `create_layout.myclass()`
This method is responsible for taking a graph structure and returning a 
`layout_ggraph` object. The object is just a `data.frame` with the correct class
and attributes added. The class should be 
`c('layout_myclass', 'layout_ggraph', 'data.frame')` and it should at least have 
a `graph` attribute holding the original graph object as well as a `circular`
attribute with a logical giving whether the layout has been transformed to a
circular representation or not. If the graph structure contains any additional
information about the nodes this should be added to the `data.frame` as columns
so these are accessible during plotting.

#### `getEdges.layout_myclass()`
This method takes the return value of `create_layout.myclass()` and returns the
edges of the graph structure. The return value should be in the form of an edge
list with a `to` and `from` column giving the indexes of the terminal nodes of
the edge. Furthermore, it must contain a `circular` column, again indicating
whether the layout should be considered circular. If there are any additional
data attached to the edges in the graph structure these should be added as 
columns to the `data.frame`.

#### `getConnection.layout_myclass()`
This method is intended to return the shortest path between two nodes as a list
of node indexes. This method can be ignored but will result in lack of support
for `geom_conn_*` layers.

#### `layout_myclass_*()`
Any type of layout algorithm that needs to be available to this class should be
defined as a separate `layout_myclass_layoutname()` function. This function will
be called when `'layoutname'` is used in the `layout` argument in `ggraph()` or
`create_layout()`. At a minimum each new class should have a 
`layout_myclass_auto()` defined.

## Layouts abound
There's a lot of different layouts in `ggraph` --- first and foremost because
`igraph` implements a lot of layouts for drawing node-edge diagrams and all of
these are available in `ggraph`. Additionally, `ggraph` provides a lot of new
layout types and algorithms for your drawing pleasure.

### A note on circularity
Some layouts can be shown effectively both in a standard Cartesian projection as
well as in a polar projection. The standard approach in `ggplot2` has been to 
change the coordinate system with the addition of e.g. `coord_polar()`. This
approach --- while consistent with the grammar --- is not optimal for `ggraph`
as it does not allow layers to decide how to respond to circularity. The prime
example of this is trying to draw straight lines in a plot using 
`coord_polar()`. Instead circularity is part of the layout specification and
gets communicated to the layers with the `circular` column in the data, allowing
each layer to respond appropriately. Sometimes standard and circular 
representations of the same layout get used so often that they get different
names. In `ggraph` they'll have the same name and only differ in whether or not
`circular` is set to `TRUE`:

```{r}
# An arc diagram
ggraph(graph, layout = 'linear') + 
    geom_edge_arc(aes(colour = factor(year)))
```

```{r}
# A coord diagram
ggraph(graph, layout = 'linear', circular = TRUE) + 
    geom_edge_arc(aes(colour = factor(year)))
```

```{r}
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(flare$edges, vertices = flare$vertices)
# An icicle plot
ggraph(graph, 'partition') + 
    geom_node_tile(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25)
```

```{r}
# A sunburst plot
ggraph(graph, 'partition', circular = TRUE) + 
    geom_node_arc_bar(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25)
```

Not every layout has a meaningful circular representation in which cases the 
`circular` argument will be ignored.

### Node-edge diagram layouts
`igraph` provides a total of 13 different layout algorithms for classic 
node-edge diagrams (colloquially referred to as hairballs). Some of these are
incredibly simple such as *randomly*, *grid*, *circle*, and *star*, while others
tries to optimize the position of nodes based on different characteristics of
the graph. There is no such thing as "the best layout algorithm" as algorithms
have been optimized for different scenarios. Experiment with the choices at hand
and remember to take the end result with a grain of salt, as it is just one of a 
range of possible "optimal node position" results. Below is an animation showing
the different results of running all applicable `igraph` layouts on the 
highschool graph.

```{r, fig.show='animate', dev='jpeg'}
library(tweenr)
igraph_layouts <- c('star', 'circle', 'gem', 'dh', 'graphopt', 'grid', 'mds', 
                    'randomly', 'fr', 'kk', 'drl', 'lgl')
igraph_layouts <- sample(igraph_layouts)
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(highschool)
V(graph)$degree <- degree(graph)
layouts <- lapply(igraph_layouts, create_layout, graph = graph)
layouts_tween <- tween_states(c(layouts, layouts[1]), tweenlength = 1, 
                              statelength = 1, ease = 'cubic-in-out', 
                              nframes = length(igraph_layouts) * 16 + 8)
title_transp <- tween_t(c(0, 1, 0, 0, 0), 16, 'cubic-in-out')[[1]]
for (i in seq_len(length(igraph_layouts) * 16)) {
    tmp_layout <- layouts_tween[layouts_tween$.frame == i, ]
    layout <- igraph_layouts[ceiling(i / 16)]
    title_alpha <- title_transp[i %% 16]
    p <- ggraph(graph, 'manual', node.position = tmp_layout) + 
        geom_edge_fan(aes(alpha = ..index.., colour = factor(year)), n = 15) +
        geom_node_point(aes(size = degree)) + 
        scale_edge_color_brewer(palette = 'Dark2') + 
        ggtitle(paste0('Layout: ', layout)) + 
        theme_void() + 
        theme(legend.position = 'none', 
              plot.title = element_text(colour = alpha('black', title_alpha)))
    plot(p)
}
```

#### Hive plots
A hive plot, while still technically a node-edge diagram, is a bit different
from the rest as it uses information pertaining to the nodes, rather than the
connection information in the graph. This means that hive plots, to a certain
extend is more interpretable as well as less vulnerable to small changes in the
graph structure. They are less common though, so use will often require some 
additional explanation.

```{r}
V(graph)$friends <- degree(graph, mode = 'in')
V(graph)$friends <- ifelse(V(graph)$friends < 5, 'few', 
                           ifelse(V(graph)$friends >= 15, 'many', 'medium'))
ggraph(graph, 'hive', axis = 'friends', sort.by = 'degree') + 
    geom_edge_hive(aes(colour = factor(year), alpha = ..index..)) + 
    geom_axis_hive(aes(colour = friends), size = 3, label = FALSE) + 
    coord_fixed()
```

### Hierarchical layouts
Trees and hierarchies are an important subset of graph structures, and `ggraph`
provides a range of layouts optimized for their visual representation. Some of
these uses enclosure and position rather than edges to communicate relations
(e.g. treemaps and circle packing). Still, these layouts can just as well be 
used for drawing edges if you wish to:

```{r}
graph <- graph_from_data_frame(flare$edges, vertices = flare$vertices)
set.seed(1)
ggraph(graph, 'circlepack', weight = 'size') + 
    geom_node_circle(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25, n = 50) + 
    coord_fixed()
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
ggraph(graph, 'circlepack', weight = 'size') + 
    geom_edge_link() + 
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = depth)) +
    coord_fixed()
```

```{r}
ggraph(graph, 'treemap', weight = 'size') + 
    geom_node_tile(aes(fill = depth), size = 0.25)
```

```{r}
ggraph(graph, 'treemap', weight = 'size') + 
    geom_edge_link() + 
    geom_node_point(aes(colour = depth))
```

The most recognized tree plot is probably dendrograms though. Both `igraph` and
`dendrogram` object can be plotted as dendrograms, though only `dendrogram` 
objects comes with a build in height information for placing the branch points. 
For igraph objects this is inferred by the longest ancestral length:

```{r}
ggraph(graph, 'dendrogram') + 
    geom_edge_diagonal()
```

```{r}
dendrogram <- as.dendrogram(hclust(dist(iris[, 1:4])))
ggraph(dendrogram, 'dendrogram') + 
    geom_edge_elbow()
```

Dendrograms are one of the layouts that are amenable for circular 
transformations, which can be effective in giving more space at the leafs of the
tree at the expense of the space given to the root:

```{r}
ggraph(dendrogram, 'dendrogram', circular = TRUE) + 
    geom_edge_elbow() + 
    coord_fixed()
```

## More to come
This concludes the first of the introduction posts about `ggraph`. I hope I have
been effective in describing the use of layouts and illustrating how they can 
have a very profound effect on the resulting plot. Stay tuned for more...
