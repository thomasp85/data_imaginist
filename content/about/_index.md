I'm a bioinformatician/computational biologist turned data scientist who focuses 
on improving researchers interactions with the data they produce. I develop 
visualizations, frameworks and GUI's as well as related tools (mostly in R). I'm 
currently employed by [SKAT](http://www.skat.dk) as a data scientist.

I'm on twitter ([@thomasp85](https://twitter.com/thomasp85)) and 
[GitHub](https://github.com/thomasp85) mainly, though you can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasp85). My posts about R are published 
on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) together with a lot of other 
amazing R related content.

Are you interested in R courses or training - do reach out and we'll see if we 
can make it work!

There should probably be some more about me here, but it must be added another 
day...
